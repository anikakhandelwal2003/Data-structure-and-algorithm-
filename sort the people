// You are given an array of strings names, and an array heights that consists of distinct positive integers. Both arrays are of length n.

// For each index i, names[i] and heights[i] denote the name and height of the ith person.

// Return names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.


// Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
// Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
// Explanation: Mary is the tallest, followed by Emma and John.
